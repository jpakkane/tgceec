How to participate

Select which category you wish to participate in. For this example
we will use the plain category. Create a subdirectory in the category
subdir to store your entry in. It can have any name, but it is recommended
to make it short and relatively unique, such as an abbreviation of your name.

mkdir bobmcbob

In this subdirectory create a source file whose name is the same as
the directory and with the suffix cpp.

touch bobmcbob/bobmcbob.cpp

Create an info file in the subdirectory with your contact info.
It must be called info.txt and contain the following three lines.

email your@email-address.com
title How you wish your creation to be called
author The Name or alias by which you wish to be called

Your email address or the name of the entry directory will not be published.

Write your entry in the cpp file. You can inspect your results by
running the measurement script.

./measure.py

If your entry has problems, the script will tell you.

If you participate in the anything category, you need to create two more
files, a package file and include directory file. The package file
contains a list of Ubuntu packages (one per line) that must be installed
in order to compile the code. It is called packages.txt. The include
file lists the directories, also one per line, that must be put in the search 
path for your compilation. It is called includes.txt.

Each category has a working sample entry. Feel free to use them to create
your version.

Once your code passes validation it is ready for submission. Zip up your
directory.

zip -r bobmcbob.zip plain/bobmcbob

Now you can email it to <email.address@somewhere.com>. Note that if
you submit an entry that does not pass the validation check, it will
be silently rejected from the competition. It is your responsibility
to verify that your code passes.
